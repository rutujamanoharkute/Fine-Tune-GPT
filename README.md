# Fine-Tuning GPT Model

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT model to better suit a specific task or domain. The fine-tuning process leverages a specialized dataset to adapt the model's output, improving its performance and relevance to the target application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- GPU-enabled environment (optional, but recommended for faster training).
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Preparation

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset that is relevant to the task or domain for which you are fine-tuning the GPT model.
2. **Data Formatting**: Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including tokenization if necessary.

## Fine-Tuning the Model

1. **Load the Pre-trained GPT Model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

   model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   ```python
   # Example: Tokenize and prepare your dataset here
   ```

3. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir='./results',
       num_train_epochs=3,
       per_device_train_batch_size=4,
       save_steps=10_000,
       save_total_limit=2,
   )

   trainer = Trainer(
       model=model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=train_dataset,
   )

   trainer.train()
   ```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics, such as perplexity or other domain-specific evaluation methods.

## Usage

After fine-tuning, the model can be used for:

- Generating domain-specific text.
- Enhancing automated writing tools.
- Building specialized chatbots.

Example usage:
```python
input_text = "Enter your prompt here."
output = model.generate(tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt'))
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
